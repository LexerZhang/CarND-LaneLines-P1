**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

This markdown file explains all the designing trivials of my project for project 1 of the Udacity course "Self-Driving Car Engineering".

---

### 1. Pipeline Designing

**The pipeline consists altogether 4 steps, which I would explain below in detail.**
#### Step 1: Establish the Canny Edge Detector and Adjust its parameters
#### Step 2: Select region of interest inside the edge map.
#### Step 3: Establish the Hough Transmission and Adjust its parameters.
#### Step 4: Draw the 2 lane lines based on the Hough Edges.

### 2. Assessment on the Pipeline
#### Testing Result
#### Short-Commings

### 3. Potential Improvements of the Pipeline
#### 1) Build a GUI tool for parameter adjusting
#### 2) Take curved lane lines into consideration
